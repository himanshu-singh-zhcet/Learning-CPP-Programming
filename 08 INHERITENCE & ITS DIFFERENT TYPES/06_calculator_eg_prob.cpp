/* prob--> As I have given you an exercise on inheritance to solve in the previous tutorial. In this tutorial, we will see the solution 
to that exercise. So the question was to make three classes “SimpleCalculator”, “ScientificCalculator” and “HybridCalculator”.
In “SimpleCalculator” class you have to take input of 2 numbers and perform function (+, -, *, /)
In “ScientificCalculator” class you have to take input of 2 numbers and perform any 4 scientific operations
You have to inherit both “SimpleCalculator” and “ScientificCalculator” classes with the “HybridCalculator” class.You have to make an 
object of the “HybridCalculator” class and display the results of “SimpleCalculator” and “ScientificCalculator” classes.         */
